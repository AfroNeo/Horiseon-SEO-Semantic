Title: Challenge0
Description: For this challenge I worked on a website called “Horiseon” which specialises in Search Engine Optimization.
The client instructions were to make their website more accessible by using ‘semantic’ html code to replace ‘non-semantic.’

I updated the website html and CSS with what was required by replacing non-semantics with semantics and removing the period (.) in the CSS file code on the container of those linked html sections. 

When I made a change, I double checked the website and to ensure I did not break anything, and when I did, I amended it accordingly sometimes starting from the beginning to see where I made my errors or did not change something.

I ‘git add .’ and ‘git commit -m “(your text)” along the way. When I wanted to push my completed work to GitHub I then ‘git push origin main.’

I was motivated to build on to this project because I wanted to implement my learning and understanding of ‘semantic’ elements and see how the changes I made would indeed make the site easily more accessible to visitors. I learnt that improved accessibility to a website provides more information to the visitor for example when an image is not displaying, they will see the text language describing the image. More importantly, it provides the SEO on search engines and the functionality of the website.

I did not make too many changes to the CSS as I felt there wasn’t much I could do, it appeared normal.
